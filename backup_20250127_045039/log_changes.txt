# Log Changes for main.py  
  
## Date: 2025-01-27  
  
### Issue:  
Logs are not being written to logs/bot/bot.log, but are being written to the console.  
  
### Steps Taken:  
  
1. **Verify Directory Structure**:  
   - Ensure that the `logs/bot` directory exists.  
   - Command: `mkdir -p logs/bot`  
  
2. **Check Permissions**:  
   - Ensure that the application has write permissions to the `logs/bot` directory and the `bot.log` file.  
   - Command: `chmod -R 755 logs`  
  
3. **Update Logging Configuration**:  
   - Ensure the logging configuration in `main.py` points to `logs/bot/bot.log`.  
   - Updated code snippet:  
     ```


# Log Changes for Logging Utility

## Date: 2025-01-27

### Issue:
Logging configuration was insufficient for a professional-grade trading bot, with limited logging capabilities and poor file management.

### Improvements in `src/utils.py`

1. **Enhanced Logging Configuration**:
   - Implemented comprehensive logging utility with multiple handlers
   - Added file and console logging support
   - Introduced log rotation to manage file sizes
   - Improved log formatting with detailed context

2. **Key Features Added**:
   - `setup_logger()` function for global logging configuration
   - Flexible log level and directory configuration
   - Automatic log directory creation
   - Rotating file handler with size and backup count management
   - Detailed log formatter including:
     * Timestamp
     * Logger name
     * Log level
     * Filename
     * Line number

3. **New Utility Functions**:
   - `get_module_logger()` for module-specific logging
   - `LoggerMixin` for easy logging integration in classes

### Code Complexity and Design Improvements
- Added type hints for better type safety
- Comprehensive docstrings explaining function behaviors
- Modular design supporting multiple logging scenarios
- Prevention of duplicate log handlers
- Supports custom log levels and naming

### Recommended Usage
```python
# Global logging setup
from utils import setup_logger
logger = setup_logger(name='trading_bot', log_level=logging.DEBUG)

# Module-specific logger
from utils import get_module_logger
module_logger = get_module_logger('strategy', log_level=logging.INFO)

# Using LoggerMixin in classes
from utils import LoggerMixin

class TradingStrategy(LoggerMixin):
    def execute_trade(self):
        self.logger.info("Executing trade")
```

### Future Considerations
- Potential expansion of logging configurations
- Support for more advanced logging backends
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead with efficient log rotation
- Configurable log levels for different environments
- Supports both development and production logging needs
