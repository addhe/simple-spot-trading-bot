   - ✅ Implemented retry mechanism for specific errors
   - ✅ Added error-specific sleep intervals
   - ✅ Enhanced error logging with proper context

3. **Validation System**

- [ ] Implement position tracking system
- [ ] Add position validation
- [ ] Implement position reporting

## Next Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 Continuation)

1. **Interface Implementation**
   - [ ] Create MarketDataProvider interface
   - [ ] Create OrderManagerInterface
   - [ ] Create RiskManagerInterface
   - [ ] Create TradingStrategy interface
   - [ ] Create PositionManagerInterface

2. **Configuration System**
   - [ ] Implement settings validator
   - [ ] Add environment-specific configurations
   - [ ] Add configuration schema validation

3. **Testing Framework**
   - [ ] Create test fixtures for new components
   - [ ] Add unit tests for new validation methods
   - [ ] Add integration tests for component interaction
   - [ ] Add thread safety tests

## Implementation Priority Order

1. High Priority (Next Sprint)
   ```
   1. Position Tracking System
   2. Health Check Implementation
   3. Enhanced Error Recovery
   4. Basic Metrics Collection
   ```

2. Medium Priority
   ```
   1. Resource Management
   2. Configuration Validation
   3. Status Reporting
   ```

3. Low Priority
   ```
   1. Advanced Metrics
   2. Memory Management
   3. Cache Management
   ```

## Testing Requirements

For each new component, we need:
1. Unit tests covering core functionality
2. Integration tests for component interaction
3. Performance tests for critical paths
4. Error handling tests
5. Resource cleanup tests

## Documentation Needs

1. Update interface documentation
2. Add metrics documentation
3. Document health check procedures
4. Update error handling documentation

## Risk Assessment

### New Identified Risks
1. Memory leaks from inadequate resource cleanup
2. Performance impact from metrics collection
3. False positives in health checks
4. Error recovery loops

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement resource monitoring
2. Optimize metrics collection
3. Add timeout mechanisms
4. Implement circuit breakers

## Progress Metrics
- Phase 1: 80% Complete
- Phase 1.5 (New Improvements): 0% Complete
- Overall Project: 35% Complete

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of health checks
2. Set up metrics collection system
3. Implement position tracking
4. Enhance error recovery system

## Notes
- All new features should maintain backward compatibility
- Performance impact should be monitored
- Documentation should be updated in parallel
